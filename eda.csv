4,2018-07-29,Charcoal Fabric ,"The Echo is an amazing device.  Many times it seems very intuitive.  But at other times I ask for something that seems clear and simple and get no result.  Installation was fairly straightforward, but I messed up several times simply because I thought a step was complete when it wasn't.  This actually made me lose ground until I figured that out.  My advice is to be patient; the app will let you know when you can move on to the next step.My biggest issue of the moment is that we have several Echo devices in our home and I would like to use them as intercoms (which I am told can be done).  However, I can't make any of the Echos aware of the others existence.  When I ask Alexa how to do this she answers about instructions how to change her name.  I know this is likely my fault, but I would think the designers would anticipate this and make it easier to find the needed instructions.  A small deal for many device savvy people, but a challenge for me.",1,echo amazing device many times seems intuitive times ask something seems clear simple get result installation fairly straightforward messed several times simply thought step complete n't actually made lose ground figured advice patient app let know move next step biggest issue moment several echo devices home would like use intercoms told done however ca n't make echos aware others existence ask alexa answers instructions change name know likely fault would think designers would anticipate make easier find needed instructions small deal many device savvy people challenge

3,2018-06-12,Black,"I received my Echo Dot today in good condition, but be advised: I paid $29.99 for it and Amazon has (as of this writing) raised the price to $39.99, so do your research before buying so you can get a good deal!Set up with the Dot went simple enough — plug it in, follow the app instructions... except initially it took a while to actually show up in my iPhone’s WiFi settings. I called Amazon customer service, and I dunno what it is, but lately I’ve been getting terrible support. The guy that took my call just rambled off a (completely unhelpful) script and I ended up setting up the Dot while he was in the middle of his spiel.I’m not sure if this is the norm or if it’s because this is refurbished, but the Dot has a pretty finicky wifi range and randomly disconnects even though the app shows that the range of my 5GHz connection is strong. Reconnecting is a pain each time as well.All that said, when Alexa works, she works amazingly well. I don’t have a speaker hooked up to it, but one thing I really enjoy is the mic’s range and sensitivity. One of the more annoying limitations of Apple’s Siri is that when she’s playing audio through device speakers (music, podcasts, etc), the “Hey Siri” feature is all but useless. Alexa has no problem hearing me over whatever is playing at the time, and with amazingly fast responsiveness too. I haven’t tried this with louder speakers yet, so I’m not sure if this will continue to hold true.Setting up Alexa to control all my wireless devices was a breeze, albeit with limitations — support for Arlo devices is nil, and if you have special settings for your LED devices (eg. rainbow effects), Alexa can’t handle them, she only knows how to change solid colors and brightness levels.All in all, my rating would’ve been lower had I not gotten a decent price on this item. If the connectivity problems persist, I may have to exchange/return this item. I don’t want to though — Alexa’s kind of growing on me.",1,received echo dot today good condition advised paid amazon writing raised price research buying get good deal set dot went simple enough plug follow app instructions except initially took actually show iphone wifi settings called amazon customer service dunno lately getting terrible support guy took call rambled completely unhelpful script ended setting dot middle spiel sure norm refurbished dot pretty finicky wifi range randomly disconnects even though app shows range ghz connection strong reconnecting pain time well said alexa works works amazingly well speaker hooked one thing really enjoy mic range sensitivity one annoying limitations apple siri playing audio device speakers music podcasts etc hey siri feature useless alexa problem hearing whatever playing time amazingly fast responsiveness tried louder speakers yet sure continue hold true setting alexa control wireless devices breeze albeit limitations support arlo devices nil special settings led devices eg rainbow effects alexa handle knows change solid colors brightness levels rating would lower gotten decent price item connectivity problems persist may exchange return item want though alexa kind growing

The Echo Spot solves the efficiency problem by displaying the information that you're routinely interested in.

My favorite part about this is having it in our living room where it's hooked up to our bluetooth soundbar - where I can just say play any song I want and it will.  I guess I could just pick up my smartphone to do that, but you don't know how much easier it is to interact with media using your voice rather than navigating through multiple pages.The one thing that I am not a fan of is the home screen cards do not really rotate that much - they also do not rotate when playing music.  I'd love for it to display the weather as I listen to music.The screen is clear and I also really enjoy Alexa being able to tell me how my commute will be - there is a great skill that you can download that will tell you traffic to 5 different places (that you program and name) so you can say alexa give me traffic to my parents - and she will tell you the best route and time you will arrive in current traffic.  I have this programmed for my parents, fiances parents, work, and her work.  So it really works great.The one thing that I actually preferred the Dot over the Spot is the dot will light up different colors when you have package notifications.. I have not seen the Spot really do much for package notifications yet.  The dot it was very easy to tell when something was delivered.  I would recommend Amazon do exactly what they did for the Dot but on the Spot - the Dot lights up colors - why can't the Spot ?  The same way you command alexa and you get that blue ring, just make that ring yellow when a package is updated for delivery.Overall it's a great device that I am looking forward to integrating my home around.  I'm already looking at dash buttons, smart plugs, etc..- and = when I become a home owner instead of renting where I can't tinker with my thermostat I will be purchasing a Nest down the road for HVAC integration.",1,got prime day figured 'd see hype honestly n't really want like personally bugging house seems kinda weird honestly love like way world going loved much ordered n't get show looks like came 's downright ugly interest watching anything devices anyway spot 's screen bother although clear alexa hear pretty much everywhere favorite part living room 's hooked bluetooth soundbar say play song want guess could pick smartphone n't know much easier interact media using voice rather navigating multiple pages one thing fan home screen cards really rotate much also rotate playing music 'd love display weather listen music screen clear also really enjoy alexa able tell commute great skill download tell traffic different places program name say alexa give traffic parents tell best route time arrive current traffic programmed parents fiances parents work work really works great one thing actually preferred dot spot dot light different colors package notifications seen spot really much package notifications yet dot easy tell something delivered would recommend amazon exactly dot spot dot lights colors ca n't spot way command alexa get blue ring make ring yellow package updated delivery overall 's great device looking forward integrating home around 'm already looking dash buttons smart plugs etc become home owner instead renting ca n't tinker thermostat purchasing nest road hvac integration

3,2018-07-17,Black  Spot,"This is 1 of 6 echo devices in the house and is currently being deployed as a bedside alarm clock.  I use it basically as an echo dot with a clock attached and may occasionally pull up camera video.  Audio quality and screen quality are really are not appropriate for music or watching video.  Much of the time it works well as alarm clock, but there are some serious flaws, particularly if you are the last one to bed or the first to wake.  It doesn’t seem like the engineers actually tested this in a bedroom with 2 people on different schedules.  Try walking into a dark bedroom with a sleeping wife and waking her up by saying “Alexa set an alarm for 5am” and then having Alexa repeat “OK alarm set for 5am.”  Not good.  I suppose you could whisper then fumble for the volume down button but that is stupid.  Plain and simple, this device needs to be brought into the 1990’s and have simple touch screen interface added to set an alarm.  I know there is a cumbersome interface for these situations where one can set an alarm from the alexa app on your phone.  No thanks, if I’m picking up my phone to set an alarm I will just use its built in alarm and save a step.  At least the engineers allow the alarm to be turned off from the touch screen, so for example if you wake up a few minutes early you can cancel the alarm without speaking and waking your spouse.  The interface for using the touch screen to cancel an alarm that has gone off is however not great.  There should be separate snooze and cancel buttons.  Currently a touch snoozes and a swipe cancels.  It is too easy when half awake to snooze when you think you have cancelled.  When the snoozed alarm goes off a few minutes later, my not amused and no longer sleeping wife will let me know by summoning Alexa to turn off the bathroom lights while I’m in the shower.",1,echo devices house currently deployed bedside alarm clock use basically echo dot clock attached may occasionally pull camera video audio quality screen quality really appropriate music watching video much time works well alarm clock serious flaws particularly last one bed first wake seem like engineers actually tested bedroom people different schedules try walking dark bedroom sleeping wife waking saying alexa set alarm alexa repeat ok alarm set good suppose could whisper fumble volume button stupid plain simple device needs brought simple touch screen interface added set alarm know cumbersome interface situations one set alarm alexa app phone thanks picking phone set alarm use built alarm save step least engineers allow alarm turned touch screen example wake minutes early cancel alarm without speaking waking spouse interface using touch screen cancel alarm gone however great separate snooze cancel buttons currently touch snoozes swipe cancels easy half awake snooze think cancelled snoozed alarm goes minutes later amused longer sleeping wife let know summoning alexa turn bathroom lights shower

Example: Secret Agent Man by Johnny Rivers...a “live”version is used, not the original version.  If I’m going to pay for Prime Music...I’d like to hear the original version of songs...not later recordings.  Or at least give me a choice of what I want to hear.

Echo can even play my local radio station. I love that the echo is connected to my TiVo Bolt. This allows TiVo to pause, stop and play whatever I want with a simple voice command. I love that I can reorder items that I purchased on Amazon and that the echo plus notifies me when my order is mailed, when it will be delivered and when the package has been delivered.

The speakers are okay but could be improved. Also I have the echo dot and it never has given me any problems with the internet. Well the other day I received a Red Light Right on my Echo Plus. This error was Sorry I’m having trouble understanding you please try again later. After research online I learned it was a problem connecting to my internet. And it was easy to find this out.

But, the ads say &#34;Hub included&#34; so don't need anything else to operate devices. Well, not so. I understand there will be some differences in product device  support. The fact that it came with the Hue light bulb works only for on /off/ dimming of the bulb. The bulb is capable of so much more with the Hue App but the Hue app does not recognize Alexa hub as a bridge. So, it appears you do have to get a Philips bridge to set the bulbs for scenes, time the lights when you are away, set color tones, etc. That can all be done via internet with your phone or tablet away from home. The list goes on for its capabilities but not without its own bridge.

They are essentially the same in dimension, weight and the woofer is the same save for the smaller tweeter point up instead of down and the built in hub. As many folks already pointed out, the hub is not a direct replacement for the Philips Hue, Z wave or anything else. It provides a sub set of features available from the stand alone hub and you ended up losing functionality that you took for granted on the dedicated hub. For me, the voice recognition and music play capability is the same, the original Echo may have an edge on the volume department due to larger speakers. The new Echo plus is priced lower than the original Echo with the built in hub but I don't really need the hub with less functionality. In addition, I don't think that Amazon will have software updates for this hub as other dedicated hub would have so bugs could end up never fixed. My Philips hub gets software update probably once every couple months and it keeps up with the changes in the new bulbs FW and they fixes bugs.

5,2018-07-20,Black  Plus,"Incredible piece of technology.I have this right center of my living room on an island kitchen counter. The mic and speaker goes in every direction and the quality of the sound is quite good. I connected the Echo via Bluetooth to my Sony soundbar on my TV but find the Echo placement and 360 sound more appealing. It's no audiophile equipment but there is good range and decent bass. The sound is more than adequate for any indoor entertaining and loud enough to bother neighbors in my building. The knob on the top works great for adjusting volume. This is my first Echo device and I would imagine having to press volume buttons (on the Echo 2) a large inconvenience and not as precise. For that alone I would recommend this over the regular Echo (2nd generation).The piece looks quality and is quite sturdy with some weight on it. The rubber material on the bottom has a good grip on the granite counter-- my cat can even rub her scent on it without tipping it over.This order came with a free Philips Hue Bulb which I installed along with an extra one I bought. I put the 2 bulbs into my living room floor lamp, turned on the light, and all I had to do was say &#34;Alexa, connect my devices&#34;. The default names for each bulb was assigned as &#34;First light&#34; and &#34;Second light&#34;, so I can have a dimmer floor lamp if I just turned on/off one of the lights by saying &#34;Alexa, turn off the second light&#34;. In the Alexa app, I created a 'Group' with &#34;First light&#34; and &#34;Second light&#34; and named the group &#34;The light&#34;, so to turn on the lamp with both bulbs shining I just say &#34;Alexa, turn on The light&#34;.I was surprised how easily the bulbs connected to the Echo Plus with its built in hub. I thought I would have to buy a hub bridge to connect to my floor lamp power plug. Apparently there is some technology built directly inside the bulb! I was surprised by that. Awesome.You will feel like Tony Stark on this device. I added quite a few &#34;Skills&#34; like 'Thunderstorm sounds' and 'Quote of the day' . Alexa always loads them up quickly. Adding songs that you hear to specific playlists on Amazon Music is also a great feature.I can go on and on and this is only my second day of ownership.I was lucky to buy this for $100 on Prime Day, but I think for $150 is it pretty expensive considering the Echo 2 is only $100. In my opinion, you will be paying a premium for the Echo Plus and you have to decide if the value is there for you:1) Taller and 360 sound unit.2) Volume knob on top that you spin (I think this is a huge benefit over buttons)3) Built in hub for Hue bulbs. After researching more, there are some cons to this setup if you plan on having more advanced light setups. For me and my floor lamp, it's just perfect.I highly recommend it and will buy an Echo dot for my bedroom now.",1,incredible piece technology right center living room island kitchen counter mic speaker goes every direction quality sound quite good connected echo via bluetooth sony soundbar tv find echo placement sound appealing 's audiophile equipment good range decent bass sound adequate indoor entertaining loud enough bother neighbors building knob top works great adjusting volume first echo device would imagine press volume buttons echo large inconvenience precise alone would recommend regular echo nd generation piece looks quality quite sturdy weight rubber material bottom good grip granite counter cat even rub scent without tipping order came free philips hue bulb installed along extra one bought put bulbs living room floor lamp turned light say alexa connect devices default names bulb assigned first light second light dimmer floor lamp turned one lights saying alexa turn second light alexa app created 'group ' first light second light named group light turn lamp bulbs shining say alexa turn light surprised easily bulbs connected echo plus built hub thought would buy hub bridge connect floor lamp power plug apparently technology built directly inside bulb surprised awesome feel like tony stark device added quite skills like 'thunderstorm sounds ' 'quote day ' alexa always loads quickly adding songs hear specific playlists amazon music also great feature go second day ownership lucky buy prime day think pretty expensive considering echo opinion paying premium echo plus decide value taller sound unit volume knob top spin think huge benefit buttons built hub hue bulbs researching cons setup plan advanced light setups floor lamp 's perfect highly recommend buy echo dot bedroom

Ordered the Amazon Fire Stick from Best Buy. Instructions were short and easy to follow. I was going to order the Amazon Ethernet Adapter because I was worried about wireless speeds in my area, but thought I'd wait and see. Glad I did. Wireless connection has proved almost flawless so far. A few brief hiccups here and there, but I'm convinced that was from the Apps themselves. Don't miss the ridiculously high cable prices and am able to watch most of what I used to watch for a much lower price, which right now is a total of $50 a month. Amazon Fire Stick is limited to 1GB of memory and 8GB of storage. Thought that would be a huge issue when it came to downloading Apps and recording shows. So far it hasn't been any issue at all. The upcoming fall tv schedule, which includes the return of NFL Football, might prove more troublesome when I need to record more often. I'll worry about that then. My only real issue is that you can't really turn it off. The screen remains on and uses up electricity, although probably small amounts. Luckily when you unplug it, all downloaded Apps and recorded shows stay in memory. Not sure what happens when you have something scheduled to record when it's unplugged. Haven't tried it yet, although I don't think it'll be an issue with DirectTV Now, which I'm using right now. So far I'm loving the Amazon Fire Stick. Actually love that Amazon, which I use occasionally, come pre-installed.",1,recently cut cord cable television needed easy install relatively inexpensive alternative option fill gap ordered amazon fire stick best buy instructions short easy follow going order amazon ethernet adapter worried wireless speeds area thought 'd wait see glad wireless connection proved almost flawless far brief hiccups 'm convinced apps n't miss ridiculously high cable prices able watch used watch much lower price right total month amazon fire stick limited gb memory gb storage thought would huge issue came downloading apps recording shows far n't issue upcoming fall tv schedule includes return nfl football might prove troublesome need record often 'll worry real issue ca n't really turn screen remains uses electricity although probably small amounts luckily unplug downloaded apps recorded shows stay memory sure happens something scheduled record 's unplugged n't tried yet although n't think 'll issue directtv 'm using right far 'm loving amazon fire stick actually love amazon use occasionally come pre installed

4,2018-07-30,Black  Dot,I love my Dot and am hoping to add a couple more around the apartment. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because I wish the speaker would be just a little better. I know Amazon probably wanted to keep costs down for this item but I really like to play music around the apartment when I am busy doing things so if they would have added a speaker with just a little more wattage and bass response they would have something great to put in the bathroom or kitchen where there might not be a lot of space for a full sized Echo. I would have been willing to pay 10 to 20 dollars more if it had a better speaker. Oh well it is what it is and I still love it. I'm just going to have to find a Bluetooth speaker that sounds good but doesn't take up a whole lot of space.,1,love dot hoping add couple around apartment reason n't give stars wish speaker would little better know amazon probably wanted keep costs item really like play music around apartment busy things would added speaker little wattage bass response would something great put bathroom kitchen might lot space full sized echo would willing pay dollars better speaker oh well still love 'm going find bluetooth speaker sounds good n't take whole lot space
